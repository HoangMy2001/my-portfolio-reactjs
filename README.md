# üåê Personal Portfolio Website By ReactJS (Frontend)

This is a personal portfolio website project, built to showcase my abilities, skills, personal projects visually and experiences as a Frontend Developer with a strong interest in UI/UX design. With the criteria of convenience, practicality and minimalist design.

## ‚ú® Outstanding features
- **Responsive Design**: The website works well on computers and phones.
- **Smooth Scroll**: Makes navigating between sections smoother.
- **Modern design**: Focuses on content.
- **Font Awesome integration**: Use professional icons for contact and skills sections.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology used
- **HTML5 & CSS3**: Basic structure and formatting.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Handling small interactions like scrolling.
- **ReactJS**: Building the user interface (UI) using a component-based architecture. I used React to create reusable components (e.g., project cards, header) to manage the application's state and render dynamic content efficiently.
- **Font Awesome**: Vector icon library.
